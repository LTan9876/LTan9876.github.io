        Hi!  My name is Lily and I'm from Brooklyn, New York.  I studied biology in college at Stony Brook University because I was always curious about how things worked.  That curiousity didn't go away after college, and during my time at real estate startup, I wanted to know in more detail what it meant to create software - so I joined Grace Hopper Academy.

        At Grace Hopper I was fully immersed in learning Javascript and finding out how to apply it to build out a front and back end.  Even after graduating, I realize there is still so much new technology to learn!  [FILL IN WHAT CURRENT WORK IS BEFORE PUSHING]
